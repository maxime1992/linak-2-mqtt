# Linak2MQTT

- Linak to MQTT dockerized service
- Use your bluetooth dongle without the need of an ESP32 device to control your desk
- Can be integrated with Home Assistant and https://github.com/IhorSyerkov/linak-desk-card

**Credits:** This project wouldn't have been possible without the incredible work done by [@rhyst](https://github.com/rhyst) on the [idasen-controller](https://github.com/rhyst/idasen-controller) project :heart:. Don't forget to give him a :star:!

# Setup

## Prerequisites

## Bluetooth initial setup

Your host must have your desk paired and trusted as a bluetooth device first.  
The reason for that being: When starting out the docker we give access to the bluetooth dongle and all the config. This way the docker image is able to connect to the desk straight away.

From the host:

- `bluetoothctl`
- `[bluetooth]# power off`
- `[bluetooth]# power on`
- Press the button on the desk for 2 or 3s till the LED is blinking
- `[bluetooth]# scan on`

Example of output while the scan is on

```
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Discovering: yes
[CHG] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX RSSI: -83
[CHG] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX RSSI: -71
[NEW] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX Desk 7734 <-- notice the [NEW] here
[CHG] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX RSSI: -75
[CHG] Device XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX RSSI: -95
```

- `[bluetooth]# scan off`
- `[bluetooth]# trust XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
- `[bluetooth]# pair XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`

And from here you should see the prompt like this `[Desk 7734]#` meaning you're connected to the desk, at which point you must disconnect from it by typing `[Desk 7734]# disconnect`

All the configuration on the side of the host is now done and you should not have to manipulate anything here anymore.

## Run the docker image

The docker image will connect to your desk and interact with it through MQTT so that you can interact with it the way you want.

Before building and launching it:

- Copy `linak-2-mqtt.env.template` into a new file called `linak-2-mqtt.env` and update the values
- Copy `linak-config.yaml.template` into a new file called `linak-config.yaml` and update the values (at least the mac address)

Then:

- `docker build -t linak-2-mqtt .`
- `docker run -it --rm --privileged -v /var/run/dbus:/var/run/dbus -v $(pwd)/linak-2-mqtt.env:/.env -v $(pwd)/linak-config.yaml:/linak-config.yaml linak-2-mqtt`

## MQTT interactions

You can listen to:

- `linak-2-mqtt/desk-height-updated` which will pass the desk height as payload in cm

You publish to:

- `linak-2-mqtt/set-desk-height` pass the desk height you wish in cm
- `linak-2-mqtt/toggle-desk-position` no payload needed

## Home Assistant integrations

The MQTT API ensure you can build any kind of integration you'd like. Speaking for myself, I've chosen to use [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io). In this seection I'll explain how to specifically integrate your desk in Home Assistant and give some examples of automations.

### Lovelace linak-desk-card

[@IhorSyerkov](https://github.com/IhorSyerkov) has built a great (interactive) [Lovelace card](https://github.com/IhorSyerkov/linak-desk-card):

| Desk in sitting position                                                    | Desk in standing position                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Desk in sitting position](assets/lovelace-desk-card-sitting-position.png) | ![Desk in standing position](assets/lovelace-desk-card-standing-position.png) |

This was originally built to integrate with [ESPHome idasen-desk-controller](https://github.com/j5lien/esphome-idasen-desk-controller) _(see [linak-desk-card](https://github.com/IhorSyerkov/linak-desk-card)'s documentation)_, but I didn't want to have using another device hence why I built my own solution.

That's why we've got a little bit of configuration to make on Home Assistant in order to have the card working properly.

- Start by following [linak-desk-card's README](https://github.com/IhorSyerkov/linak-desk-card) and install the card using HACS
- Open your HA config file `/config/configuration.yaml` and either create or update your `sensor` and `binary_sensor` lists with the following:

```yaml
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: linak_desk_height
      state_topic: 'linak-2-mqtt/desk-relative-height-updated'
    - name: linak_desk_absolute_height
      state_topic: 'linak-2-mqtt/desk-absolute-height-updated'
    - name: desk_need_update
      state_topic: 'linak-2-mqtt/need-update'
    - name: desk_sitting_status
      state_topic: 'linak-2-mqtt/sitting-status'
  binary_sensor:
    - name: is_desk_available
      state_topic: 'linak-2-mqtt/desk-relative-height-updated'
      off_delay: 100
      value_template: "{{ 'online' }}"
      payload_on: 'online'
      payload_off: 'offline'
```

On your dashboard, we'll now create a new card:

```yaml
type: custom:linak-desk-card
min_height: 62
max_height: 127
presets:
  - label: Stand
    target: 120
  - label: Sit
    target: 73
name: Desk
height_sensor: sensor.linak_desk_height
connection_sensor: binary_sensor.is_desk_available
# @todo not implemented because I'm unsure what that'll change and it's not a priority for now
# moving_sensor: binary_sensor.is_desk_moving
desk: cover.desk
```

**Important note:**

Make sure the config above matches:

- The one defined in `linak-2-mqtt.env` that you're mounting on the docker container for:
  - `min_height` / `DESK_LOWEST_HEIGHT_CM`
  - `max_height` / `DESK_HIGHEST_HEIGHT_CM`
- The one defined in `linak-config.yaml` that you're mounting on the docker container:
- `presets[label="Stand"].target` / `stand_height`
- `presets[label="Sit"].target` / `sit_height`

This is slightly annoying to have some configuration duplicated but I haven't found a better option for now and it's not something you'll need to edit all the time.

Everything we did so far was in order to get the correct height displayed on the desk card. Now lets hook the 2 buttons stand and sit so we're able to control the desk from that card as well.

In order to do that, you'll need to create the following `automation`:

```yaml
alias: 'Desk: Bind cover.set_cover_position to MQTT'
description: ''
trigger:
  - platform: event
    event_type: call_service
    event_data:
      domain: cover
      service: set_cover_position
condition: []
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: linak-2-mqtt/set-desk-height
      payload_template: >
        {% set service_data =
        trigger.event.as_dict().get('data').get('service_data') %} {{
        ((service_data.get('position') * (127 - 62) / 100) + 62) | round(0) }}
mode: single
```

Note: Same here, it'd be nice to get the `127` _(max height)_ and `62` _(min height)_ from the card config if possible but I haven't done it for now.

### Toggle the current position between sit and up using an NFC tag

```yaml
alias: 'Tag Desk: Toggle desk position'
description: ''
trigger:
  - platform: tag
    tag_id: YOUR-TAG-ID-HERE
condition: []
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: linak-2-mqtt/toggle-desk-position
mode: single
```

### Automatically put the desk up for daily standup meetings

Last but not least, if you have some daily standup meeting for example, you could automatically put the desk up at that time if:

- It's a work day
- You're home
- A manual input boolean is currently on (in case you ever want to turn it off simply)

All this should let you avoid unnecessary triggers.

```yaml
alias: 'Desk: Standing position at standup time on workday if I am home'
description: ''
trigger:
  - platform: time
    at: '10:59:00'
condition:
  - condition: zone
    entity_id: device_tracker.PHONE_TRACKER_HERE
    zone: zone.home
  - condition: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.workday_sensor
    state: 'on'
  - condition: state
    entity_id: input_boolean.shoulddeskgostandingpositiononworkdaysifiamhome
    state: 'on'
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      topic: linak-2-mqtt/set-desk-height
      payload: '120'
mode: single
```

Don't forget to create both:

- the `input_boolean` helper
- the `workday_sensor` if you don't have one already. _Example:_

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  # ... your other binary sensors
  - platform: workday
    name: workday_sensor
    country: FR
    workdays: [mon, tue, wed, thu, fri]
    excludes: [sat, sun]
```

Here's an example of complete dashboard:

```yaml

# Troubleshooting issues

If the logs show

```
[debug] Connected
starting idasen server...
Connecting
Connecting failed
Device with address XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX was not found.
```

Either:

- You've never connected the desk in bluetooth. Refer to `Bluetooth initial setup`
- Another device is already connected to the desk. Check first on your host machine if `bluetoothctl` shows `[bluetooth]#` or something like `[Desk 7734]#`. If it's `[bluetooth]` it means it's fine, the host is not connected to it (but you'll have to check your other devices like phone etc...), if it shows `[Desk 7734]#` the fix is easy, from here type `disconnect`: `[Desk 7734]# disconnect` and it should go back to `[bluetooth]#`. Stop and start again the docker image, everything should be fine
- Something has just gone wrong and none of the above fixes it. Try first on the host to
  - Turn the bluetooth on and off
    - `bluetoothctl`
    - `[bluetooth]# power off`
    - `[bluetooth]# power on`
  - Connect to the device again `[bluetooth]# connect XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
  - If that works, disconnect from it straight away (`[Desk 7734]# disconnect`) and relaunch the docker image
  - If that doesn't work, you may need to remove the device and make sure that you: Find it, trust it, pair it (in this order)
    - `[bluetooth]# remove XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`
    - From here follow again the `Bluetooth initial setup` section

# Linak DPG1C integration and keep alive routine

In order to use it with the Linak DPG1C there are some caveats. A new MQTT topics has been added:
- linak-2-mqtt/need-update

As the DPG1C *needs* a wake up command that, at the time of writing, has not been implemented on the idasen server, an automation has to be done. It seems that a wake up command needs to be sended once every three hours in order to keep the connection alive. So, to do that, some logic has been added:

- if the mqttSetHeightCommand is been triggered, the time is stored in last_updated variable
- then periodicaly the difference between last_updated and now is calculated. If that time is greater than 1h the topic linak-2-mqtt/need-update is set to 1.

In HA (for example) we need to create an automation to move the desk from the bluetooth controller to keep the connection alive when the need-update topic is 1:

```
alias: Keep Desk alive
description: ""
trigger:
  - platform: mqtt
    topic: linak-2-mqtt/need-update
    payload: "1"
condition: []
action:
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      qos: 0
      retain: false
      topic: linak-2-mqtt/set-desk-height
      payload_template: "{{(int(states('sensor.linak_desk_absolute_height')))-1}}"
  - delay:
      hours: 0
      minutes: 0
      seconds: 5
      milliseconds: 0
  - service: mqtt.publish
    data:
      qos: 0
      retain: false
      topic: linak-2-mqtt/set-desk-height
      payload_template: "{{(int(states('sensor.linak_desk_absolute_height')))+1}}"
mode: single
```

# Keep track of Sitting vs Standing status

A routine has been implemented to publish to linak-2-mqtt/sitting-status if the desk is standing or sitting position.

```
if(heightCm > linakConfigYamlParsed.stand_height/10 - tolerance){
  sitting_status = "Standing"
}else if (heightCm < linakConfigYamlParsed.sit_height/10 + tolerance){
  sitting_status = "Sitting"
}
client.publish(
 `linak-2-mqtt/sitting-status`,
  sitting_status
);
```

Tolerance variable is set to 5cm. #TODO: Move it to .env file?

Then in HA configuration.yaml we can create some sensors:
```
sensor:
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Desk sitting time
    entity_id: sensor.desk_sitting_status
    state: "Sitting"
    type: time
    start: "{{ now().replace(hour=7, minute=30, second=0) }}"
    end: "{{ now().replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0) }}"  
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Desk standing time
    entity_id: sensor.desk_sitting_status
    state: "Standing"
    type: time
    start: "{{ now().replace(hour=7, minute=30, second=0) }}"
    end: "{{ now().replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0) }}"  
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Desk standing ratio
    entity_id: sensor.desk_sitting_status
    state: "Standing"
    type: ratio
    start: "{{ now().replace(hour=7, minute=30, second=0) }}"
    end: "{{ now().replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0) }}"     
  - platform: history_stats
    name: Desk sitting ratio
    entity_id: sensor.desk_sitting_status
    state: "Sitting"
    type: ratio
    start: "{{ now().replace(hour=7, minute=30, second=0) }}"
    end: "{{ now().replace(hour=17, minute=0, second=0) }}"  
```

Note that this only keeps track of the sitting vs standing times and ratio from 7:30 to 5 which are mine working hours. Please change it to yours :)
